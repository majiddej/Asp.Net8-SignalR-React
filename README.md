# Real-time Online User Tracker with ASP.NET Core and React

This project demonstrates a simple real-time online user count tracker using **SignalR** in an **ASP.NET Core Web API** backend and a **React** frontend. The application shows the number of connected users in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time communication** using SignalR
- **User authentication** support with JWT (or other mechanisms)
- Display the **online user count** in the React app
- Easily extendable for user-specific notifications and tracking

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8** for the backend API
- **SignalR** for real-time updates
- **React** for the frontend
- **JWT Authentication** (can be replaced with any authentication provider)
  
## Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Node.js and npm
- SQL Server (optional, depending on your authentication setup)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core Web API)
Navigate to the Server folder:

```bash
Copy code
cd Server
Install dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
Configure JWT or other authentication mechanisms in Program.cs if necessary. For example, to use JWT:

csharp
Copy code
builder.Services.AddAuthentication("Bearer")
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.Authority = "https://your-identity-server";
        options.Audience = "your-api";
    });
Run the API:

```bash
Copy code
dotnet run
The API should now be running at https://localhost:5001.

3. Frontend Setup (React)
Navigate to the Client folder:

```bash
Copy code
cd Client
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the React development server:

```bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

4. SignalR Integration
The SignalR hub is available at the /userCountHub endpoint in the ASP.NET Core Web API. The React app connects to this hub to listen for real-time updates about the online user count.

In your React app, ensure that you have the following setup to connect to the SignalR hub:

javascript
Copy code
import * as signalR from '@microsoft/signalr';

const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl("https://your-api-url/userCountHub", {
    accessTokenFactory: () => localStorage.getItem("token") // Replace with how you store the token
  })
  .withAutomaticReconnect()
  .build();

connection.start()
  .then(() => console.log("Connected to SignalR"))
  .catch(err => console.error("SignalR Connection Error: ", err));
5. Authentication
Ensure that your authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT) is properly set up in both the ASP.NET Core API and the React app.

Backend: Configure JWT authentication in Program.cs.

Frontend: Ensure the JWT token is passed when connecting to the SignalR hub.

Example for adding the JWT token in React:

javascript
Copy code
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
  .withUrl("https://your-api-url/userCountHub", {
    accessTokenFactory: () => localStorage.getItem("token") // Fetch your stored token
  })
  .withAutomaticReconnect()
  .build();

Usage
The online user count is updated in real-time as users connect and disconnect from the server.
The user identity is accessed via Context.User within the UserCountHub to provide personalized data, if needed.
Future Enhancements
Add user-specific notifications.
Persist online user states across sessions.
Extend the app to track user activity in different areas of the app.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Step 2 (Backend Setup)**: This step now comes after cloning the repository and includes commands to install dependencies and run the API.
2. **SignalR Integration and JWT**: Clearer instructions on setting up the SignalR hub and passing the JWT token in the React app.
3. **Project Structure**: The structure now accurately reflects the separation of backend (ASP.NET Core) and frontend (React).
